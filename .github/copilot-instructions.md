# Copilot Instructions

## Privacy & Personal Information

**NEVER include personal information without explicit user permission.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- Full names or last names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Physical addresses
- Any PII inferred from file paths, usernames, or system information

**Always use GitHub usernames/handles only** unless the user explicitly provides and approves personal details for inclusion.

Just because information is technically visible in terminal output, file paths, or system environment does not mean it should be used or referenced.

## Code Standards

- Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- Follow existing project patterns and style
- Run `npm run check` before committing
- Do not include "Co-authored-by" lines in commits unless requested
